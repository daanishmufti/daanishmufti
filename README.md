# Hi there, I'm Daanish Mufti! 👋

I am a Computer Science student at GIKI University, passionate about programming and technology. I love to explore different programming languages and currently, I am an expert in C++. I am also learning languages like Python, Rust, C#, and Ruby to broaden my skillset.

## My Journey

🚀 I started my programming journey back in 7th grade when I began tinkering with electronics and programming Arduino-based boards.

🐍 In college, I delved into programming with Python 3, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at GIKI University.

📚 Currently, I am honing my skills in C++ and exploring its applications in various domains.

## Projects

🔧 I am actively working on multiple projects, which you can explore in my GitHub repository.
